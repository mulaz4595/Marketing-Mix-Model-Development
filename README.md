# Marketing Mix Model Analysis

## Dashboard
[Live Dashboard](https://mulaz4595.github.io/Marketing-Mix-Model-Development/Advertising%20and%20Sales%20Analysis%20Dashboard.html)

## Objective of analysis
I built this dashboard to analyze how different advertising channels affect sales. The goal was to figure out which marketing channels give the best return on investment and how to allocate budget more effectively.

## The Analysis
I looked at advertising spend across TV, radio, digital, and print channels to see their impact on sales. The model helps identify which channels are driving the most revenue and where we might be over or under-investing.

## Files
- `Advertising and Sales Analysis Dashboard.html` - The main dashboard with all the charts and analysis
- `Marketing Mix Modelling.ipynb` - The Python notebook where I did the data work and built the model

## Key Findings
The dashboard shows performance metrics for each channel, attribution analysis, and ROI calculations. You can see which channels are performing well and get recommendations for budget reallocation.

## Technical Notes
Built the dashboard using HTML for the visualizations. The underlying analysis was done in Python using standard data science libraries.
